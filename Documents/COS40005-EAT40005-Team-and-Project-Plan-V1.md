#### 3. Teamwork Roadmap and Collaboration Framework

This framework outlines the processes and tools the team will use to maintain momentum, ensure transparency, and foster a productive working environment.

*   **Meeting Cadence:**
    *   **Class Sync (Twice Weekly):** Mandatory meetings will occur during scheduled class times on Tuesdays and Thursdays. These sessions will be used for formal progress reviews, sprint planning, and supervisor consultations.
    *   **Working Sessions (Twice Weekly):** Additional, less formal working sessions will be scheduled on Fridays and Saturdays. These are hands-on, collaborative sessions dedicated to coding, debugging, and integration.
    *   **Mode of Operation:** The default mode for all meetings will be in-person to facilitate high-bandwidth communication. An online option via Microsoft Teams will be available for members who are unable to attend physically.

*   **Communication Plan:**
    *   **Informal/Daily Communication:** **WhatsApp** will be the primary channel for quick questions, daily updates, and urgent coordination. A maximum response time of 12 hours is expected.
    *   **Formal Communication:** **Email** will be used for all official communication with the project supervisor (Dr. Vong) and for documenting key decisions.
    *   **Technical Discussion:** **GitHub Issues and Pull Requests** will be the venue for all technical discussions, code reviews, and bug tracking to keep conversations linked to the relevant code.

*   **Task Management Workflow:**
    *   **Tool:** The team will exclusively use **GitHub Projects** and **GitHub Issues** for all task management.
    *   **Lifecycle of a Task:** Each task will be created as an Issue and will progress through the following stages on the project board:
        1.  **Backlog:** Awaiting prioritization.
        2.  **To Do:** Prioritized for the current sprint.
        3.  **In Progress:** Actively being worked on by an assigned team member.
        4.  **In Review:** A Pull Request has been opened and is awaiting code review.
        5.  **Done:** The Pull Request has been approved and merged, and the feature meets the Definition of Done.
    *   **Definition of Done (DoD):** A task is considered "Done" only when it meets all the following criteria:
        *   Code is successfully merged into the `main` branch.
        *   Code is formatted and linted according to project standards.
        *   All related acceptance criteria are met.
        *   The feature has been manually tested and verified by someone other than the author.
        *   Relevant documentation (if any) has been updated.

*   **Conflict Resolution:**
    1.  Disagreements should first be discussed directly and respectfully between the involved team members.
    2.  If a resolution cannot be reached, the issue will be brought to the next team meeting for a group discussion, mediated by the Project Lead.
    3.  If the team cannot reach a consensus, the Project Lead will make a final decision after considering all viewpoints.
    4.  For critical issues that impact the project scope or timeline, the matter will be escalated to the Project Supervisor for guidance.

#### 4. Document and Configuration Management

A systematic approach to managing project assets is crucial for consistency and collaboration.

*   **Code Version Control:**
    *   **System:** Git.
    *   **Platform:** GitHub.
    *   **Branching Strategy:** The team will adopt the **GitFlow** branching model.
        *   `main`: Contains production-ready, stable code. Direct commits are forbidden.
        *   `develop`: The primary integration branch for ongoing development.
        *   `feature/<feature-name>`: All new work must be done in a feature branch, created from `develop`.
        *   Pull Requests (PRs) are mandatory for merging feature branches back into `develop`. Each PR must be reviewed and approved by at least one other team member.

*   **Document Management:**
    *   **Platform:** **Microsoft OneDrive** will serve as the central repository for all non-code documents, including this project plan, user guides, meeting minutes, and research materials.
    *   **Collaborative Editing:** Microsoft Office 365 (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) will be used for real-time collaborative editing and commenting.
    *   **Backup Strategy:** In addition to cloud storage, critical documents will be backed up manually on a bi-weekly basis to a separate offline storage device.

#### 5. Risk Management

A proactive approach to risk management is essential. The following register identifies potential risks and outlines a plan to address them. This register will be reviewed and updated at the beginning of each sprint.

**Table 3: Risk Register**
| ID | Risk Description | Impact | Likelihood | Risk Owner | Mitigation and Contingency Plan |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **R1** | **Technical Skill Gap:** A team member may lack the necessary expertise in a required technology (e.g., Flutter state management, advanced RLS policies). | Medium | Medium | Project Lead | **Mitigation:** Promote a culture of knowledge sharing and pair programming. Allocate dedicated time within sprints for learning and experimentation. Encourage the use of online tutorials and documentation. <br> **Contingency:** If a critical gap persists, the team will consult with the project supervisor for expert guidance or an alternative approach. |
| **R2** | **Team Member Unavailability:** A key member becomes unavailable for an extended period due to illness or personal emergency. | High | Low | Project Lead | **Mitigation:** Enforce a strict policy of daily code commits to GitHub and maintain high-quality documentation. Implement a "buddy system" where knowledge for critical components (Backend, AI core) is shared between two members. <br> **Contingency:** The "buddy" will take over the primary responsibilities. The Project Lead will re-allocate tasks across the remaining team members and adjust the sprint scope if necessary. |
| **R3** | **Scope Creep:** The client or team introduces new features or changes that are outside the original project scope. | Medium | Medium | Project Lead | **Mitigation:** All change requests must be formally documented as a GitHub Issue. The team will perform an impact analysis to assess the effect on the timeline and resources. <br> **Contingency:** The Project Lead will present the impact analysis to Dr. Vong to get formal approval before any changes are incorporated into the project backlog. Low-impact changes may be deferred to a "post-prototype" backlog. |
| **R4** | **Integration Issues:** The frontend, backend, and AI modules fail to communicate correctly, causing significant delays late in the project. | High | Medium | All Team | **Mitigation:** Define clear API contracts (e.g., using OpenAPI/Swagger) between services early in the project. Conduct frequent integration testing throughout the development cycle. Implement a shared "mock server" so frontend and backend can develop in parallel. <br> **Contingency:** Allocate a dedicated "integration week" before the final submission to resolve any complex integration bugs. |
| **R5** | **AI Model Underperformance:** The LLM agent hallucinates, provides inaccurate recommendations, or the predictive model has low accuracy. | High | Medium | AI Engineers | **Mitigation:** Employ a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern to ground the LLM's responses in a trusted knowledge base. Use a high-quality, clean dataset for fine-tuning. Rigorously validate the predictive model's performance using standard metrics (e.g., RMSE, F1-score). <br> **Contingency:** If the LLM is unreliable, implement a stricter rule-based NLP system as a fallback for critical recommendations. If the predictive model is inaccurate, retrain it with more features or a different algorithm. |
| **R6** | **Simulated Data Unrealistic:** The patient data simulator produces data that is too simplistic or does not accurately reflect real-world health patterns, leading to a poorly trained AI model. | Medium | Medium | Backend Developer | **Mitigation:** Research common patterns in chronic disease data (e.g., post-meal glucose spikes, effect of exercise). Incorporate randomness and variability into the simulator to mimic real patient behavior. <br> **Contingency:** Consult with Dr. Vong or external resources to refine the simulation logic. Use a public, anonymized health dataset as a reference to validate the simulator's output distribution. |

### PART 2: PROJECT OVERVIEW AND PLAN

This section details the project itself, covering the problem it aims to solve, its boundaries, objectives, technical architecture, and the roadmap for its execution.

#### 1. Project Background and Problem Statement

**Background:** The management of chronic diseases like Type 2 Diabetes is a persistent challenge in modern healthcare. Patients are often overwhelmed by the need to constantly monitor various health metrics (blood glucose, diet, activity, etc.) and struggle to interpret this data effectively. Healthcare providers, in turn, lack the tools for real-time monitoring and are often limited to providing guidance during infrequent appointments, relying on incomplete, patient-recalled information. This results in a reactive, rather than proactive, approach to care.

**Problem Statement:** Chronic disease patients lack a unified platform that integrates their fragmented health data and provides real-time, actionable, and personalised guidance. Existing digital health solutions often act as simple data repositories and do not fully leverage the power of Artificial Intelligence to detect early warning signs, predict adverse events, or provide context-aware recommendations. BioTective seeks to address this gap by developing a prototype solution that serves as an intelligent companion for patients and a powerful monitoring tool for clinicians, ultimately aiming to improve health outcomes through timely, AI-driven interventions.

#### 2. Project Goals and SMART Objectives

*   **Project Goal:** To successfully design, develop, test, and deliver a high-fidelity prototype of an AI-Enabled Digital Health Platform that meets all the functional and non-functional requirements outlined in the project proposal by the end of the semester.

*   **SMART Objectives:**
    1.  **Specific:** Develop a cross-platform application (mobile and web) with distinct patient and clinician dashboards, an AI-powered recommendation engine, an automation layer for alerts, and a patient-facing chatbot.
    2.  **Measurable:** Successfully complete all 20+ user stories defined in the product backlog, achieve a code review approval rate of 100% for all merged PRs, and ensure the final prototype passes all end-to-end testing scenarios without critical bugs.
    3.  **Achievable:** The project scope is defined by six clear milestones and will be developed by a skilled five-person team using a modern, efficient technology stack. The use of a BaaS platform and high-level frameworks makes the timeline feasible.
    4.  **Relevant:** The prototype directly addresses the problem statement provided by BioTective, demonstrating a solution that can enhance patient outcomes and improve the efficiency of chronic disease care, aligning with the company's mission.
    5.  **Time-bound:** The entire project, from planning to final prototype demonstration and documentation, will be completed within the official timeline of the COS40005 Computing Technology Project A unit.

#### 3. Scope, Assumptions, and Constraints

*   **In-Scope:**
    *   Development of all features outlined in the six project milestones.
    *   A functional prototype integrating patient and clinician views.

    *   The project requirements as defined in the proposal will remain stable throughout the project lifecycle.
    *   The team has the necessary collective skills to execute the project plan.
    *   The project supervisor will be available for regular consultation and guidance.

*   **Constraints:**
    *   The project must be completed within the fixed semester timeline.
    *   The prototype will be developed using only simulated data due to the ethical and legal constraints of handling Protected Health Information (PHI).
    *   The budget for using third-party APIs (e.g., LLM providers) is limited and must be managed carefully.

#### 4. Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Role | Interest/Expectations |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **BioTective Sdn Bhd** | Client | Expects a functional, polished prototype that validates their product concept and can be used for future investment pitches or as a foundation for a production build. |
| **Ts. Dr. Vong Wan Tze** | Supervisor | Expects the team to follow a structured project management methodology, demonstrate technical proficiency, and deliver a high-quality project that meets academic standards. |

| **Development Team** | Executors | Aims to successfully deliver the project, gain practical experience in building a complex AI application, and achieve a high academic grade. |

#### 5. Detailed Solution Approach and System Architecture

The proposed architecture is a modern, decoupled system designed for scalability, security, and rapid development, leveraging best-in-class technologies for each component. This design is the result of a rigorous analysis of the cross-platform, backend, and AI framework landscapes.

*   **Frontend Architecture:**
    *   **Framework:** **Flutter**. Chosen as the definitive cross-platform solution to meet the "code once, deploy anywhere" requirement. Its compiled native performance and declarative UI paradigm (widgets) are ideal for creating the fluid, responsive user experience required for both mobile and desktop platforms.
    *   **State Management:** The team will adopt a standardized state management solution, likely **Provider** or **BLoC**, to manage application state predictably and prevent UI inconsistencies.
    *   **Data Visualization:** The **`fl_chart`** library has been selected for its rich feature set, extensive customization, and strong community support, making it perfect for rendering the required trend charts and weekly summaries.

*   **Backend Architecture:**
    *   **Language/Framework:** **Python 3.11+** with the **FastAPI** framework. This choice is non-negotiable, driven by Python's unrivalled ecosystem for AI and data science. FastAPI provides a high-performance, modern framework for building RESTful APIs with automatic documentation.
    *   **Deployment:** The Python backend will be deployed as serverless functions (e.g., on Google Cloud Functions or Vercel), managed via the chosen BaaS platform to minimize DevOps overhead.

*   **Data and BaaS Architecture:**
    *   **Platform:** **Supabase**. Chosen over Firebase for its open-source nature and powerful PostgreSQL foundation. Supabase provides an integrated suite of essential backend services out-of-the-box.
    *   **Database:** A **PostgreSQL** database managed by Supabase. A relational schema will be designed to store user data, patient health records, diet logs, and clinician-patient relationships.
    *   **Authentication:** **Supabase Auth** will be used for secure user registration and login, handling JWTs for session management.
    *   **Security:** **Row-Level Security (RLS)** is the cornerstone of the security architecture. Fine-grained SQL policies will be written directly in the database to enforce strict data access rules. For example: `CREATE POLICY "Patients can only see their own data." ON health_records FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);`. This ensures that data segregation is enforced at the lowest possible level, preventing accidental data leaks.

*   **Hybrid AI Architecture:**
    The project will implement a sophisticated hybrid AI model, as a single monolithic model is suboptimal for the diverse tasks required. This strategy separates quantitative analysis from qualitative reasoning.
    1.  **The "Quantitative Analyst" (Predictive Model):**
        *   **Model:** An **XGBoost** or **RandomForest** model.
        *   **Function:** This traditional machine learning model will be trained on the simulated data to perform precise, numerical forecasting tasks, such as predicting the peak blood glucose level after a logged meal. Its output is a structured, numerical value.
    2.  **The "Qualitative Strategist" (LLM Agent):**
        *   **Model:** A powerful foundation Large Language Model (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 3) with strong tool-calling capabilities.
        *   **Framework:** **LangChain**. This framework will be used to create an autonomous agent.
        *   **Function:** The agent acts as the system's "brain." It receives context (e.g., patient data, the prediction from the Quantitative Analyst) and uses its reasoning ability to decide on a course of action. It can then use a predefined set of "tools" (custom Python functions) to execute this plan. For instance, it could use a tool to fetch the patient's full diet history from Supabase, another to check for recent activity, and then synthesize all this information into a comprehensive, empathetic recommendation. This is the core of the "Large Action Model" (LAM) system.

  
*(Conceptual Diagram: A flow chart showing patient data entering the system. It splits, with numerical data going to an XGBoost model for prediction. The prediction and qualitative data then go to a LangChain agent (LLM). The agent uses tools to query the Supabase DB, and finally outputs an action/recommendation back to the user via the Flutter app.)*

#### 7. Quality Assurance Plan

The team is committed to delivering a high-quality prototype. Quality is not just a final check but a continuous process integrated throughout the development lifecycle.

*   **Code Quality Standards:**
    *   **Style Guides:** The team will strictly enforce official style guides: **PEP 8** for Python and **Effective Dart** for Flutter.
    *   **Linters & Formatters:** Automated tools will be integrated into the development environment and CI pipeline. **Black** and **Pylint** for Python, and Dart's built-in `dart format` and linter for Flutter. Commits that do not pass linting will be blocked.

*   **Testing Strategy:**
    *   **Unit Testing:** Developers are responsible for writing unit tests for their code, especially for critical backend logic, utility functions, and AI model inputs/outputs. The target is to achieve a reasonable level of code coverage for business-critical modules. Tools: `pytest` for Python, `flutter_test` for Flutter.
    *   **Integration Testing:** At the end of each week, the team will conduct integration tests to ensure that the frontend can successfully communicate with the backend API and that the API can correctly interact with the Supabase database.
    *   **End-to-End (E2E) System Testing:** During the final sprint, the team will perform comprehensive E2E testing based on the user stories. This involves testing the entire workflow from the user's perspective (e.g., logging a meal, seeing a glucose spike, receiving a recommendation).
    *   **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** In the final two weeks, team members will engage in peer-UAT, where they test the features developed by others, acting as both a patient and a clinician to identify usability issues and bugs.

*   **Defect Management:**
    *   **Reporting:** All bugs and defects must be reported as a **GitHub Issue** using a standardized bug report template.
    *   **Tracking:** Each bug will be labelled, assigned a priority (Critical, High, Medium, Low), and assigned to a team member.
    *   **Resolution:** A bug is considered resolved only after a fix has been committed, merged, and the fix has been verified by the original reporter or another team member.
