### Problem Statement

Chronic disease patients often face challenges with fragmented health information and a lack of real-time, intelligent monitoring. Existing healthcare systems do not fully utilise AI to detect early warning signs or offer personalised, timely recommendations. This project addresses that gap by creating a prototype that integrates health data from multiple sources (e.g., glucose levels, diet, activity) to provide AI-powered insights, supporting proactive interventions.
