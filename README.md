**F**ramework for **L**ongitudinal **O**bservation and **R**esponse via **E**mbedded **N**eural **C**ognitive **E**ngine is a prototype digital health platform designed for the monitoring and management of chronic diseases. This project leverages AI to provide actionable insights for both patients and clinicians, aiming to enhance patient outcomes through real-time data and predictive analytics.

### Problem Statement

Chronic disease patients often face challenges with fragmented health information and a lack of real-time, intelligent monitoring. Existing healthcare systems do not fully utilise AI to detect early warning signs or offer personalised, timely recommendations. This project addresses that gap by creating a prototype that integrates health data from multiple sources (e.g., glucose levels, diet, activity) to provide AI-powered insights, supporting proactive interventions.
