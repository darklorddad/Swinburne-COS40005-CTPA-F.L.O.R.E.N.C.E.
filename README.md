### F.L.O.R.E.N.C.E.
**F**ramework for **L**ongitudinal **O**bservation and **R**esponse via **E**mbedded **N**eural **C**ognitive **E**ngine is a prototype digital health platform designed for the monitoring and management of chronic diseases. This project leverages AI to provide actionable insights for both patients and clinicians, aiming to enhance patient outcomes through real-time data and predictive analytics.

### Problem Statement

Chronic disease patients often face challenges with fragmented health information and a lack of real-time, intelligent monitoring. Existing healthcare systems do not fully utilise AI to detect early warning signs or offer personalised, timely recommendations. This project addresses that gap by creating a prototype that integrates health data from multiple sources (e.g., glucose levels, diet, activity) to provide AI-powered insights, supporting proactive interventions.

### Key Features

This platform is being developed through a series of milestones to deliver a comprehensive chronic disease management tool.

#### For Patients
* **Patient Dashboard**: A user-friendly dashboard for desktop and mobile that visualises key health metrics like glucose readings, HbA1c levels, diet history and activity logs. Features trend charts to highlight glucose spikes and provide weekly summaries.
* **Personalised Recommendation Engine**: An AI-driven module that provides personalised suggestions for meal substitutions, post-meal activities and sleep improvement, complete with explanations linking recommendations to the patient's data.
* **Interactive Chatbot**: An AI-powered chatbot that allows patients to ask questions about their health data and receive personalised, on-demand answers to improve engagement.

#### For Clinicians
* **Clinician Dashboard**: An aggregated view of patient data that highlights anomalies and uses a risk-based system to prioritise patients requiring urgent attention.
* **Automation Layer (LAM Triggers)**: Detects abnormal health patterns and automatically triggers actions such as sending reminders, educational tips and motivational prompts. It can also summarise patient status and suggest follow-up labs for high-risk indicators.

#### System-Wide
* **Robust Security**: Implements secure login with role-based access for patients and clinicians, along with data encryption and anonymisation to protect sensitive health information.
* **Data Simulation**: Includes a patient data simulator to generate realistic health datasets for development and end-to-end testing, ensuring system reliability.
