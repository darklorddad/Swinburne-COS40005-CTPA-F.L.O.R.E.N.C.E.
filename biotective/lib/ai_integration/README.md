2. **AnomalyDetector**: Identifies health pattern anomalies
3. **AutomationLayer**: Manages automated triggers and responses
4. **ChatbotService**: Handles conversational AI interactions

## 📱 User Interface

### Main Dashboard
- Tabbed interface with Recommendations, Alerts, and Automation
- Priority-based color coding for different severity levels
- Interactive cards with action buttons
- Real-time data refresh capabilities

### Health Insights
- Risk level visualization with color-coded indicators
- Glucose trend charts using fl_chart library
- Anomaly summary with detailed descriptions
- Health metrics overview cards

### Chatbot Interface
- Conversational UI with message bubbles
- Suggested questions based on patient profile
- Conversation history management
- Real-time AI responses

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK 3.9.2+
- DeepSeek API access (key provided in DeepSeek.py)

### Dependencies
```yaml
dependencies:
  http: ^1.1.0          # HTTP requests
  fl_chart: ^0.65.0     # Charts and graphs
  intl: ^0.19.0         # Date/time formatting
```

### Installation
1. Add dependencies to `pubspec.yaml`
2. Run `flutter pub get`
3. Import AI integration modules in your Flutter app
4. Initialize with patient data and health metrics

### Usage Example
```dart
// Initialize AI services
final recommendations = await RecommendationEngine.generateRecommendations(
  patientId: 'patient_001',
  recentData: healthData,
  patientProfile: patientProfile,
);

// Detect anomalies
final anomalies = AnomalyDetector.detectAnomalies(
  patientId: 'patient_001',
  recentData: healthData,
  patientProfile: patientProfile,
);

// Start automation monitoring
AutomationLayer.startMonitoring(
  patientId: 'patient_001',
  recentData: healthData,
  patientProfile: patientProfile,
);
```
